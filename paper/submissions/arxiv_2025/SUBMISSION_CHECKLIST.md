## Author Information Needed

**REQUIRED BEFORE SUBMISSION:**
1. Full names of all authors
2. Email addresses (at least for corresponding author)
3. Institutional affiliations
4. ORCID iDs (recommended)
5. Funding acknowledgments/grant numbers
6. GitHub repository URL (if making code public)

## Submission Steps

1. **Create arXiv account** (if not existing):
   - Go to https://arxiv.org/user/register
   - Obtain endorsement for cs.DS category if needed

2. **Prepare source package**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/spinoza/github/released/cbt/paper/submissions/arxiv_2025
   # After updating author info:
   tar czf cbt-arxiv.tar.gz cbt.tex
   ```

3. **Submit via arXiv**:
   - Login to https://arxiv.org/submit
   - Select "Start New Submission"
   - Category: cs.DS (primary), add cs.NA and cs.PL as cross-list
   - Upload source package
   - Enter metadata
   - Preview and submit

4. **Post-submission**:
   - Note arXiv identifier (e.g., arXiv:2025.XXXXX)
   - Update paper with arXiv ID in header
   - Share preprint link

## Submission Timeline

- **arXiv**: Can submit immediately after author info is added
- **Processing time**: Usually appears within 1-2 business days
- **Revisions**: Can update paper on arXiv after initial submission

## Quality Checks Completed

- [x] Paper length appropriate (41 pages is fine for arXiv)
- [x] Bibliography complete (55+ references)
- [x] Mathematical notation consistent
- [x] Code examples properly formatted
- [x] Theorems and proofs structured correctly
- [x] Abstract is self-contained and compelling

## Notes

- The paper is already well-formatted for arXiv
- No special style files needed (uses standard packages)
- Consider adding supplementary materials link to GitHub repository
- Paper can be submitted to conferences/journals after arXiv posting
