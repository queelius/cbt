## Abstract (for submission form - plain text)
We present Computational Basis Transforms (CBT), a unifying framework that formalizes the common pattern underlying diverse algorithmic techniques—from the Fast Fourier Transform to automatic differentiation—as systematic transformations between computational domains. We establish rigorous mathematical foundations using category theory, proving a fundamental No Free Lunch theorem: any non-trivial domain transformation that improves some operations must necessarily degrade others or incur transformation costs. This result extends complexity-theoretic insights to the structure of computational representations. We analyze ten concrete transforms within our framework, identifying novel connections such as direct mappings between logarithmic and multiscale domains that avoid numerical instability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates substantial performance improvements (8--70× speedup) for domain-appropriate operations while enabling previously infeasible computations, such as stable products of millions of near-zero probabilities. The framework reveals that computational efficiency is representation-dependent rather than problem-inherent, suggesting a paradigm shift in algorithm design: instead of optimizing within fixed representations, identify transformations to domains where desired operations are naturally efficient. We provide an open-source C++17 implementation and establish theoretical foundations for automatic CBT selection and composition. This work contributes both a unifying theoretical lens and practical tools for exploiting domain transformations in algorithm design.
