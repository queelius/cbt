## Executive Summary

### Paper Status
- **Title**: Computational Basis Transforms: A Unified Framework for Domain Transformation Algorithms
- **Length**: 41 pages, 55+ references
- **Quality**: Paper compiles successfully, mathematically rigorous, well-structured
- **Readiness**: Ready for immediate arXiv submission after author info added

### Key Findings

#### arXiv Submission (IMMEDIATE)
- ✅ Paper meets all arXiv requirements
- ✅ Proper LaTeX formatting verified
- ✅ Categories identified: cs.DS (primary), cs.NA and cs.PL (cross-list)
- ✅ Abstract and metadata prepared
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Add author information (lines 58-63)
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Update acknowledgments (line 1623)
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Update GitHub URL (line 1552)

#### Recommended Publication Strategy

**Phase 1: Immediate Visibility**
- Submit to arXiv this week (after author info)
- No modifications needed to current paper

**Phase 2: Conference Path** (Recommended: ICFP 2025)
- **Timeline**: January-March 2025 preparation
- **Why ICFP**: Perfect fit for category theory approach, values mathematical elegance
- **Required**: Condense to 25 pages, add functional programming examples
- **Backup**: POPL 2026 (July deadline) if ICFP doesn't work out

**Phase 3: Journal Option** (Parallel or Alternative)
- **Target**: ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)
- **Advantage**: No page limit, can submit current 41-page version
- **Timeline**: Can submit anytime, 3-6 month review cycle

## Venue Analysis Summary

### Top 5 Recommended Venues

1. **ACM TOMS (Journal)** - Fit: 9.5/10
   - Perfect for comprehensive mathematical software frameworks
   - No length restrictions
   - Can submit immediately after arXiv

2. **ICFP 2025** - Fit: 8.5/10
   - March 2025 deadline
   - Strong category theory community
   - Requires condensing and FP examples

3. **POPL 2026** - Fit: 9/10
   - July 2025 deadline
   - Premier programming languages venue
   - Values theoretical foundations

4. **STOC 2025** - Fit: 7.5/10
   - Top theory venue
   - Would need significant condensing (10 pages)
   - Deadline likely passed

5. **PLDI 2025** - Fit: 7/10
   - Implementation-focused
   - Would need more empirical evaluation
   - Good for practical impact

## Critical Path Forward

### Week 1 (Immediate)
1. **Author provides information** (See AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md)
2. **Submit to arXiv**
3. **Receive arXiv identifier**
4. **Share preprint publicly**

### Month 1 (January 2025)
1. **Decide on conference target** (ICFP vs POPL)
2. **Begin paper adaptation**
3. **Add venue-specific content**

### Month 2-3 (February-March 2025)
1. **Complete conference version**
2. **Internal review**
3. **Submit to chosen venue**

## Key Documents for Author

### Must Read:
1. **`/paper/submissions/AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md`** - Your action items
2. **`/paper/submissions/arxiv_2025/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`** - arXiv specifics

### Strategic Planning:
3. **`/paper/submissions/VENUE_STRATEGY.md`** - Detailed venue analysis
4. **`/paper/submissions/icfp_2025/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`** - If targeting ICFP

## Required Author Decisions

### Immediate (For arXiv):
- ✅ Categories approved? (cs.DS, cs.NA, cs.PL)
- ✅ Abstract approved?
- ⬜ License choice? (Recommended: CC BY 4.0)
- ⬜ Make code repository public?

### Strategic (Next Month):
- ⬜ Conference vs Journal first?
- ⬜ If conference: ICFP 2025 or POPL 2026?
- ⬜ Create project website?
- ⬜ Plan for publicity (blog/social media)?

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1 month):
- arXiv submission completed
- Paper publicly available
- Conference target selected
- Adaptation begun

### Medium Term (6 months):
- Conference submission completed
- Journal submission (if chosen)
- Presentation materials ready
- Community engagement started

### Long Term (1 year):
- Paper accepted at top venue
- Code widely adopted
- Follow-up work initiated
- CBT framework recognized

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **Length**: 41 pages too long for most conferences
   - **Mitigation**: Created condensing strategy for each venue

2. **Breadth**: Some may see as survey rather than contribution
   - **Mitigation**: Emphasize No Free Lunch theorem and unifying framework

3. **Competition**: Similar work may be submitted elsewhere
   - **Mitigation**: arXiv submission establishes priority

4. **Review concerns**: May need more empirical evaluation
   - **Mitigation**: Can add benchmarks during revision

## Final Recommendations

### Do Now:
1. ✅ Review `/paper/submissions/AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md`
2. ✅ Provide author information
3. ✅ Submit to arXiv within 48 hours

### Do This Week:
1. Share arXiv link when available
2. Decide on conference strategy
3. Begin venue-specific adaptations

### Do This Month:
1. Complete conference version
2. Consider journal submission
3. Prepare presentation materials
