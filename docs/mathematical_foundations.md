# Mathematical Foundations of CBT

## Abstract

Computational Basis Transforms (CBT) provide a unified mathematical framework for understanding transformations between computational domains. This document presents the formal theory underlying CBT, including definitions, theorems, and proofs.

## 1. Formal Definition

### Definition 1.1 (Computational Basis Transform)

A **Computational Basis Transform (CBT)** is a quadruple (D, D', φ, Ω) where:

- **D** is the *original computational domain*
- **D'** is the *transformed computational domain*  
- **φ: D → D'** is the *transform function*
- **Ω** is the *trade-off specification*

The transform φ must satisfy certain properties depending on the desired computational characteristics.

### Definition 1.2 (Trade-off Specification)

The trade-off specification Ω is a tuple (G, L, C) where:

- **G** is the set of operations that become more efficient
- **L** is the set of operations that become less efficient
- **C** is the complexity change function

Formally: C: Operations × {D, D'} → Complexity Class

### Definition 1.3 (Homomorphic Transform)

A transform φ is **homomorphic** with respect to operation ⊗ if:

```
φ(a ⊗_D b) = φ(a) ⊕_D' φ(b)
```

where ⊗_D is an operation in domain D and ⊕_D' is the corresponding operation in D'.

## 2. Fundamental Theorems

### Theorem 2.1 (No Free Lunch Theorem for CBT)

**Statement**: For any non-trivial CBT (D, D', φ, Ω), if |G| > 0 then |L| > 0.

**Proof**: 
Assume by contradiction that |L| = 0, meaning no operations become less efficient. Since |G| > 0, at least one operation becomes more efficient in D'. This would imply D' is universally superior to D, contradicting the principle of computational equivalence. Therefore, |L| > 0. ∎

### Theorem 2.2 (Composition Theorem)

**Statement**: Given two CBTs (D₁, D₂, φ₁, Ω₁) and (D₂, D₃, φ₂, Ω₂), their composition forms a CBT (D₁, D₃, φ₂∘φ₁, Ω₃) where the trade-offs combine multiplicatively.

**Proof**:
The composition φ₂∘φ₁: D₁ → D₃ is well-defined since the codomain of φ₁ matches the domain of φ₂. The combined trade-off Ω₃ = (G₃, L₃, C₃) where:
- G₃ ⊆ G₁ ∩ G₂ (operations efficient in both)
- L₃ ⊇ L₁ ∪ L₂ (operations inefficient in either)
- C₃ reflects the composed complexity changes ∎

### Theorem 2.3 (Information Preservation)

**Statement**: For an invertible CBT with φ⁻¹: D' → D, information is preserved: I(x) = I(φ(x)) for all x ∈ D.

**Proof**:
Since φ is invertible, it establishes a bijection between D and D'. By the data processing inequality, I(X) ≥ I(φ(X)). Similarly, I(φ(X)) ≥ I(φ⁻¹(φ(X))) = I(X). Therefore, I(X) = I(φ(X)). ∎

## 3. Classical Transforms Analysis

### 3.1 Logarithmic Transform

**Definition**: φ_log: ℝ⁺ → ℝ ∪ {-∞}, φ_log(x) = ln(x)

**Properties**:
1. **Multiplicative Homomorphism**: φ_log(xy) = φ_log(x) + φ_log(y)
2. **Order Preservation**: x < y ⟺ φ_log(x) < φ_log(y)
3. **Continuity**: φ_log is continuous on ℝ⁺

**Trade-offs**:
- G = {multiplication, division, exponentiation}
- L = {addition, subtraction}
- Complexity: O(n²) multiplication → O(n) addition

**Theorem 3.1**: The logarithmic transform is the unique continuous multiplicative homomorphism from (ℝ⁺, ×) to (ℝ, +) up to scaling.

### 3.2 Fourier Transform

**Definition**: φ_F: L²(ℝ) → L²(ℝ), φ_F(f)(ξ) = ∫f(x)e^(-2πixξ)dx

**Properties**:
1. **Convolution Theorem**: φ_F(f * g) = φ_F(f) · φ_F(g)
2. **Parseval's Identity**: ||f||² = ||φ_F(f)||²
3. **Invertibility**: φ_F⁻¹(φ_F(f)) = f

**Trade-offs**:
- G = {convolution, differentiation, correlation}
- L = {pointwise multiplication, localization}
- Complexity: O(n²) convolution → O(n log n) via FFT

### 3.3 Odds-Ratio Transform

**Definition**: φ_OR: [0,1] → [0,∞], φ_OR(p) = p/(1-p)

**Properties**:
1. **Bayesian Update**: posterior_odds = prior_odds × likelihood_ratio
2. **Log-Odds Linearity**: log(φ_OR(p)) is linear in logit space
3. **Symmetry**: φ_OR(p) · φ_OR(1-p) = 1

**Trade-offs**:
- G = {Bayesian updates, sequential inference}
- L = {probability addition, marginalization}

**Theorem 3.2**: The odds-ratio transform converts Bayes' theorem from a division to a multiplication.

## 4. Novel Transform Properties

### 4.1 Stern-Brocot Transform

**Mathematical Structure**: The Stern-Brocot tree is a complete binary tree where:
- Each node represents a unique positive rational in lowest terms
- Left child of p/q and r/s is (p+r)/(q+s) (mediant)
- Maintains ordering: left descendants < node < right descendants

**Theorem 4.1 (Optimality)**: For any rational p/q and maximum denominator N, the Stern-Brocot algorithm finds the closest rational approximation with denominator ≤ N.

**Proof Sketch**: The convergents form the convex hull of rational approximations. Any better approximation would violate the Farey neighbor property. ∎

### 4.2 Residue Number System

**Definition**: For coprime moduli m₁, ..., m_n:
```
φ_RNS: ℤ_M → ℤ_m₁ × ... × ℤ_m_n
φ_RNS(x) = (x mod m₁, ..., x mod m_n)
```
where M = ∏m_i.

**Chinese Remainder Theorem**: φ_RNS is a ring isomorphism.

**Properties**:
1. **Parallel Operations**: Addition and multiplication are component-wise
2. **No Carry Propagation**: Each component is independent
3. **Error Detection**: Redundant moduli enable error detection

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Addition: O(1) parallel vs O(log n) sequential
- Multiplication: O(1) parallel vs O(n²) sequential
- Comparison: O(n) vs O(1)

### 4.3 Multiscale Transform

**Definition**: φ_MS: ℝ → ℝ × ℤ
```
φ_MS(x) = (mantissa(x), scale_level(x))
```
where x = mantissa × base^scale_level, mantissa ∈ [1, base)

**Properties**:
1. **Scale Invariance**: Operations preserve scale structure
2. **Automatic Scaling**: Scale adjusts to prevent overflow/underflow
3. **Precision Distribution**: Relative precision maintained across scales

**Theorem 4.2**: The multiscale transform extends the dynamic range by factor base^(2^b) where b is the bit width of the scale field.

## 5. Composition Theory

### 5.1 Compositional Algebra

**Definition**: The set of CBTs forms a category where:
- Objects are computational domains
- Morphisms are transforms
- Composition is function composition

**Theorem 5.1 (Associativity)**: Transform composition is associative:
```
(φ₃ ∘ φ₂) ∘ φ₁ = φ₃ ∘ (φ₂ ∘ φ₁)
```

### 5.2 Optimal Composition

**Problem**: Given operations O and domains D_i with transforms φ_i, find optimal composition.

**Theorem 5.2**: The optimal composition minimizes:
```
Cost = Σ_o∈O frequency(o) × complexity(o, composed_domain)
```

**Example**: For extreme-scale multiplication:
- multiscale handles range (10^±100)
- logarithmic handles multiplication (× → +)
- Composition: multiscale<logarithmic> is optimal

## 6. Network Theory

### 6.1 CBT Network

**Definition**: The CBT Network is a directed graph where:
- Nodes are computational domains
- Edges are transforms between domains
- Edge weights represent transformation costs

**Properties**:
1. **Completeness**: Path exists between any two domains
2. **Optimality**: Shortest path minimizes transformation overhead
3. **Redundancy**: Multiple paths provide flexibility

### 6.2 Direct Mappings

**Theorem 6.1**: Direct mappings between CBT domains can avoid intermediate precision loss.

**Example**: lg → multiscale mapping:
```cpp
multiscale(e^log_value) = multiscale::from_log(log_value)
```
Avoids overflow in intermediate e^log_value computation.

## 7. Applications to Computer Science

### 7.1 Algorithmic Complexity

**Theorem 7.1**: CBTs can change the complexity class of algorithms.

**Example**: Matrix multiplication
- Standard: O(n^2.807) (Strassen)
- Log domain: Converts to addition for positive matrices
- Applications: Probabilistic graphical models, Markov chains

### 7.2 Numerical Stability

**Definition**: An algorithm is numerically stable if small input perturbations cause small output changes.

**Theorem 7.2**: Appropriate CBT selection can transform unstable algorithms into stable ones.

**Proof Sketch**: By operating in a domain where problematic operations (e.g., products of small numbers) become benign (e.g., sums), numerical stability improves. ∎

### 7.3 Parallel Computation

**Theorem 7.3**: RNS enables work-efficient parallel arithmetic with O(1) depth for addition and multiplication.

**Implications**:
- GPU acceleration without carry dependencies
- Fault-tolerant computation via redundant moduli
- Constant-time cryptographic operations

## 8. Category Theory Perspective

### 8.1 Functorial Properties

CBTs can be viewed as functors between categories:
- Source category: Operations in domain D
- Target category: Operations in domain D'
- Functor: The transform φ

**Theorem 8.1**: Homomorphic transforms are functor-preserving.

### 8.2 Natural Transformations

Mappings between different CBTs form natural transformations, ensuring coherent conversion regardless of the path taken through the CBT network.

## 9. Information Theoretic Analysis

### 9.1 Entropy Preservation

**Theorem 9.1**: Invertible CBTs preserve Shannon entropy:
```
H(X) = H(φ(X))
```

### 9.2 Computational Entropy

**Definition**: Computational entropy measures the difficulty of operations in a domain.

**Theorem 9.2**: CBTs redistribute computational entropy:
```
Σ_op C_D(op) × P(op) = Σ_op C_D'(op) × P(op)
```

## 10. Future Directions

## Conclusion
